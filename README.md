To run this, Python 3, OpenCV and Mediapipe Hands are required.
INSTRUCTIONS
Press 'g' on the keyboard to begin the game and place your hand in a fist in the centre of the frame. The camera should be looking at your hand from the side so the fingers can be seen fully. Your hand should not be perpendicular to the camera. A countdown will begin, after the countdown, make the moves of rock paper and scissors in sync with the animated hand and upon detection of your chosen gesture, an animation will play displaying the winner.
